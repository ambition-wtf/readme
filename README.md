# ambition README

## A word from our sponsor: gratitude! 🙏

Thank you SO much for joining the Collaboration team with Ambition.

This is the start of something epic: a new model for decentralized creative work at scale.

That being said, because this is only the beginning, we’re still figuring out how to do this along the way.

I **NEED** you to to tell me what is working and what isn’t.

This is a living, growing document 🌱 that if you’re reading, I hope you will play a part in watering, nurturing, 🪴 and developing.

### Why this exists?

Solo dev work is easy. Group dev is hard.

The purpose of this document is to succinctly align the vector of our dev effort, for maximization of efficiency.

### What is it?

An attempt at creating a common understanding, a foundation, for us to build together on.

That way we can focus on the part that excites us: building magical things, not minutia like code formatting.

## Dev Guidelines

> "Permission is granted to anyone to change anything, at anytime."

If **ANYTHING** is less than ideal, it’s your responsibility to change it, or if you can't, talk to the person who can.

As a dev, the Developer Experience is _literally_ one of my highest values. I’m here for you. I want you to create your best work.

#### Expectations

I don’t write the best code.
So I don’t expect you to.

But I do iterate a LOT.
So I expect you to do this is as well.

Iteration is a superpower. Refactors are friends.

### My Responsibilities

I’m going to review everyone’s code.
Please submit and share your work early, in draft state, to save BOTH of us time.

I WILL frequently request changes, it’s nothing personal.
Hopefully it can be a learning experience, and will save BOTH of us time.

If ANYTHING is unclear, please ask me.

#### Standards

- Tabs, so that you can choose own your indentation
- Automatic code formatters, so all our code looks consistent

#### Guidelines

- <ins>JavaScript</ins>
  - No semicolons, because less is more
  - Prefer Typescript, because fewer bugs
- Solidity
  - 100% test code coverage before deployment to testnet
  - Deployment to testnet before mainnet
  - Because once it's deployed, there's no takesy-backsies
- Github
  - Commits
    - Frequently, progressively, incrementally
  - Pull requests
    - Small to respect reviewer's time
    - Detailed descriptions of work completed with screenshots of work if applicable
- If you're blocked
  - <1 hour → google it
  - > 1 hour → contact me
  - times are rough, if you think I'll know the answer immediately, then immediately ask me!
